# TriviaGame

I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I used valid HTML and stylish CSS to layout this app. My trivia game is composed of a total of 10 questions and it shows only one question at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out.

If the player selects the correct answer, the next screen will congratulate them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, I then display the next question without user input.

The player has 10 seconds to answer the question. If the player runs out of time, I let the player know that time's up and display the correct answer. After a few seconds, the next question is showed.

If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is shown another page showing them that they selected the wrong option and the correct answer is displayed as well. After a few seconds, the next question is showed.

On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game is displayed. After clicking restart the questions get shuffled and the trivia game starts again with the same question but in different order.
